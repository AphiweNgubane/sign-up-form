# sign-up-form

Sign-up Form showcases some new skills I have learnt in HTML and CSS.

This is a sign-up webpage for an imaginery company. Some form basics that were used:
- Input elements of different types
- A submit button
- some form styling

I also included a validations to ensure the user is inputting the correct information before submitting the form.
- required (also marked with an asterisk)
- minimum + maximum text length for the password
- pattern validation for the phone number
- styling validation (green for valid, red for invalid)

What I struggled the most with is the phone number input element when I was working on the pattern validation. I wanted the format to be:
27 (83) 123-4567
However, I couldn't figure out how to include brackets without break the code/ causing an error. So I opted to keep it simple with just digits required and no signs.
